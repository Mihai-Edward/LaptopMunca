
If you have to do this parameters alone without influence what do you choose to do and why? 
what do you think is the most valuable parameters since the draws are from 5 to 5 minutes non stop 
this is the format that i want , ignore numbers:
Data _analysis.py file 
count_frequency: 144     # 12 hours - More responsive to current patterns
hot_and_cold_numbers: 36 # 3 hours - Very recent trends
analyze_gaps: 144        # 12 hours - Recent enough for meaningful gaps

# Prediction Generator parameters(prediction_generator.py file(recent analysis)

prediction = predictor.generate_prediction(
predict_count=15,          # Number of numbers to predict
 recent_window=36,          # 3 hours - Highly focused on current trends
  freq_weight=0.50,          # Increased from 0.45 - Most reliable indicator
  hot_cold_weight=0.30,      # Increased from 0.25 - More weight on recent trends
  gap_weight=0.20,          # Unchanged - Supporting indicator
   triplets_weight=0.0,       # Removed completely
   historical_influence=0.05   # Unchanged - Minimal historical influence
