first lets give you all the detalis and i will give the files in the attachemnt of this message.So i m workig with a complete version of data analysis from my previous trial to make a lottery predict generator . So the idea is that now i want to focus on let s methouds , because my previous version was so complex that he miss the point . I think the most important methouds that we need to use is frequncy based on last draws, gap, hot_and_cold numbers, Trending up and trending down , and common pairs. I want you to tell me how can i upgrade this prediction generator to follow only this . A new aspect is that i have over 4000 historycal data, and i think i need some models who need to train on this before they make a prediction, since is so much data involve. I tried various models before but they need a lot of training time, so i will need your  help with some models who let s take , 2 minutes let s say maximum to generate a predicion.   Another option will be to not use models, and do try use only my data siince is so big. So i wait for you suggestion , feedeback, and questions, before you try to provide solutinons
